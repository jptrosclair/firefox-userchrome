# firefox-userchrome

Combines nav-bar and tabs into a single row in the title bar. Based on reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/7pwxpt/underrated_17074_change_smaller_menus_for_desktop/dslp94k/). Changes made to work better with built-in firefox themes and density settings.
